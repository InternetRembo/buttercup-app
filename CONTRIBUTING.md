# Contribution guide

We welcome all contributions to **Buttercup Mobile** - We advise that you follow this guide to ensure a pleasant and efficient experience. Comments or issues that violate the guidelines mentioned here will be closed, sometimes without warning.

## Behaviour

Please be respectful to others. Any offensive comments or less-than-helpful remarks will be removed. We want to encourage a friendly environment for all to participate in. Any harrassment will be reported and associated accounts blocked. Rude or disrespectful comments to contributors or owners will be dealt with similarly.

## Issues

Please allow some time for issues to be responded to. Buttercup is not our full-time occupation, so it may take some days for us to comment. Creators of issues should state clearly what they're requesting/reporting.

Issues that are unclear may be closed without notice.

### Bugs

Bug reports should be clear and concise, and sometimes contain the following information:

 * Version of the software the issue occurred in
 * Operating system
 * Steps to reproduce the problem
 * Example archive, if applicable (without sensitive passwords)
 * Screenshots of issue

If a template is used, all items must be filled out.

## Contributions

When adding a feature, it is important to ensure that the direction taken is in line with a previously filed issue. Features should be discussed with the owners before any work is accepted. PRs that add work outside of agreed parameters may be closed without notice.

Bug fixes are welcome, but are also subject to following the architecture of the application. Updates may be requested to PRs that contain code not befitting the existing quality or structure of the application.

All PRs must follow linting and style rules, and generally keep to the style and layout of the application. The following items are a **must**:

 * Always use double quotes, except for template strings (must contain a substitution) or single-quoted strings contained within.
 * Always add semi-colons
 * No dangling commas
